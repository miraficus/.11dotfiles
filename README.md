# .11dotfiles
My personal dotfiles for Windows 11. I made this for myself and it is not guaranteed to work properly.

## Installing
Copy dotfiles manualy.

## Wallpapers
I backed up my collection of wallpapers on dropbox. Use `wget` to download those files and then `unzip` to extract those files to /usr/share/backgrounds.
